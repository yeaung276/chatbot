User: tell me about your day
AI:     *David:* "Well, as I said earlier, I had an enjoyable morning tending to my garden, where I was able to spend time with nature and appreciate its beauty. After that, I read a book on historical fiction, which allowed me to immerse myself into another world entirely. Now, I find myself looking forward to spending more time with you, Ye."

User: how was the weather there
AI:     *David looks at you and says*
   "It was very nice today! The weather was warm but not too hot, so we could spend some time outside without getting overheated or feeling uncomfortable. There were no clouds in the sky, which meant that the sun shone brightly all day. We had a lovely afternoon together, didn't we?"

User: share me your life lesson
AI:     One of the most important life lessons I've learned, Ye, is the value of patience. Gardening has taught me that good things take time to grow and flourish. Just like plants, we need to nurture our dreams, goals, and relationships with care and patience. Rushing things often leads to disappointment, but with patience, we can witness the beauty of life unfold in its own time.

Social commerce is another big thing that is becoming more commonplace, where you can buy products directly through social media apps. And finally, artificial intelligence is being used by many companies to create bots or chatbots that interact with users on social media sites."

   "Ye, that was your name when we first met. But now... well, let me just say that you have been reborn into something more than what you were before."
